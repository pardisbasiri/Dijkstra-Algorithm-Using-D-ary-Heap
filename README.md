# Dijkstra-Algorithm-Using-D-ary-Heap

In this project I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph using a D-ary heap data structure. The D-ary heap allows for efficient extraction of the node with the smallest distance, making it a suitable choice for optimizing the algorithm's time complexity. 

I initialized distances to infinity for all nodes except the starting node, and iteratively explored neighboring nodes, updating their distances if a shorter path is found. The algorithm maintained a priority queue of nodes in the D-ary heap, ensuring that the node with the smallest distance is always processed next.
